# hootDate
This was an incomplete project for video chat dating.

It is written in Python using the Django framework.

# Background
This project was a collaborative effort to implement peer-to-peer videochat using Python.

Sadly, the constraints on time (3 days) forced us to fall-back on existing tech (WebRTC) and the easiest deployment was using node.

So this app (if you took the time to spin-up multiple servers) is functioning, but honestly, if I had to do it over again, I'd just build it in the mean stack.
